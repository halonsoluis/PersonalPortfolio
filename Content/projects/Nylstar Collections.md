### My contribution

This was my first project as an iOS Developer. I was part of a team of 4 highly motivated guys craving for knowledge and excited about Swift.

We built the app from scratch and many of itâ€™s following iterations once it was published in the AppStore. The work made demanded a lot of communication, collaboration, and iterations in design.
