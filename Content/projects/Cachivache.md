## Cachivache

[Cachivache](https://gitlab.com/hugoalonsoluis/Cachivache) was a project for allowing to download and visualize the contents of an independent, young, and energetic publication startup dealing with the challenges that suppose the lack of connectivity in Cuba.

Main goal being to be able to bring offline access to all the posts made by their publication (cachivachemedia.com) Itâ€™s some sort of a Pocket, but exclusively for them and having special consideration for offline us

It allowed to:

- Favorite, download and visualize posts.
- Set, edit and filter by tags.
- Analytics across the app.

### My contribution

For this project, I was the solo-developer. The app was in the AppStore until the publication decided to stop their project.

Among the main challenges: - Download the content from the posts from Medium (where the publication is hosted) - Provide a customizable and reliable offline experience. - Guarantee that all the content is downloaded as fast as possible while connected to the internet (as in Cuba the internet is slow and limited/expensive in time)
