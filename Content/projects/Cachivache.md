### My contribution

For this project, I was the **solo-developer**. The app was in the AppStore until the publication decided to stop their project.

Main goal being to be able to bring offline access to all the posts made by their publication (cachivachemedia.com) Itâ€™s some sort of a Pocket, but exclusively for them and having special consideration for offline us

It allowed to:

- Favorite, download and visualize posts.
- Set, edit and filter by tags.
- Analytics across the app.


#### Among the main challenges: 


- Download the content from the posts from Medium (where the publication is hosted) 

- Provide a customizable and reliable offline experience.

- Guarantee that all the content is downloaded as fast as possible while connected to the internet (as in Cuba the internet is slow and limited/expensive in time)
