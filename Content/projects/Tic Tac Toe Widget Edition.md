### My contribution

• Single player mode against an AI including 3 levels of difficulty

• Multiplayer mode (Human vs Human in the same device)

• Persistence of the statistics and state of the game when dismissing the Notification Center.


This app was created in the following months of the release of the widgets and apple watch APIs from Apple.

The most challenging part of the development was the need to explore the limits of the Widgets environment and discover & fix undocumented memory issues.

From here that the app had to be rebuilt 3 times before we could publish it in the AppStore. Our standards about quality were high, and we couldn’t allow an app that would close itself in unexpected moments.

I can’t deny that it was super fun and challenging to create. I was leading a team of 4 iOS developers working on the app from concept to the AppStore.
