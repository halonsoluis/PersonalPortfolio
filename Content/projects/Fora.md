### My contribution

I was part of the initial team working on the creation of all the online presence of FORA (Android, iOS, Web, Backend).

My role, as part of a team of 4 iOS developers, was to create the Minimum Viable Product. Our teamwork and motivation resulted in achieving the goals in record time and retain an important client.
