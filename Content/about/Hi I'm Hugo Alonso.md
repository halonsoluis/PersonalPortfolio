I'm an iOS Software Engineer

Hi!, A *happy human* that loves being a `coder` over here!
My name is Hugo, and I'm a proud Cuban discovering the rest of the world.

I’m always eager to improve my skills and explore other points of view. I started to code in **Delphi**, **C++** & **Java**, after several languages and technologies.., I’m now comfortably using **Swift** for creating iOS apps.

I’m really curious, so I like to get a grasp of almost every disruptive technology… I guess I’m kind of a technological polygamist 😅.

Oh.. **I enjoy teaching**, I have been a 👨🏻‍🏫 for several years and through StackOverflow, I have had the opportunity to continue when not in the classroom.

✌🏻
