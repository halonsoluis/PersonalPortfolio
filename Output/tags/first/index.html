The main idea was to present data from the <a href="https://developer.marvel.com/">Marvel API</a>.</p><h3>My contribution</h3><p>I created a completely functional version in approximately 14 days using Swift 3, <a href="https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxSwift">RxSwift</a> and Storyboards. It uses <a href="https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire">Alamofire</a> for networking and <a href="https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher">KingFisher</a> for the caching of images. For handling dependencies it was used <a href="https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage">Carthage</a>.</p><p>This was the first time I used blur effects and custom transitions in an app, and I ❤️ it!</p><p>Later on, I started experimenting with it and it has been my playground for testing and Continuous Integration using <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/product/continuous-integration/">GitlabCI</a>. Currently is updated to Swift 5.</p></article></li><li><article><h1>Cachivache</h1><h3>My contribution</h3><p>For this project, I was the <strong>solo-developer</strong>. The app was in the AppStore until the publication decided to stop their project.</p><p>Main goal being to be able to bring offline access to all the posts made by their publication (cachivachemedia.com) It’s some sort of a Pocket, but exclusively for them and having special consideration for offline us</p><p>It allowed to:</p><ul><li>Favorite, download and visualize posts.</li><li>Set, edit and filter by tags.</li><li>Analytics across the app.</li></ul><h4>Among the main challenges:</h4><ul><li>Download the content from the posts from Medium (where the publication is hosted)</li></ul><ul><li>Provide a customizable and reliable offline experience.</li></ul><ul><li>Guarantee that all the content is downloaded as fast as possible while connected to the internet (as in Cuba the internet is slow and limited/expensive in time)</li></ul></article></li><li><article><h1>Fora</h1><h3>My contribution</h3><p>I was part of the initial team working on the creation of all the online presence of FORA (Android, iOS, Web, Backend).</p><p>My role, as part of a team of 4 iOS developers, was to create the Minimum Viable Product. Our teamwork and motivation resulted in achieving the goals in record time and retain an important client.</p></article></li><li><article><h1>Tic Tac Toe Widget Edition</h1><h3>My contribution</h3><p>• Single player mode against an AI including 3 levels of difficulty</p><p>• Multiplayer mode (Human vs Human in the same device)</p><p>• Persistence of the statistics and state of the game when dismissing the Notification Center.</p><p>This app was created in the following months of the release of the widgets and apple watch APIs from Apple.</p><p>The most challenging part of the development was the need to explore the limits of the Widgets environment and discover &amp; fix undocumented memory issues.</p><p>From here that the app had to be rebuilt 3 times before we could publish it in the AppStore. Our standards about quality were high, and we couldn’t allow an app that would close itself in unexpected moments.</p><p>I can’t deny that it was super fun and challenging to create. I was leading a team of 4 iOS developers working on the app from concept to the AppStore.</p></article></li><li><article><h1>Beattune</h1><p>The measurements were visile on the iPhone and on the Apple Watch.</p><p>The aim was to enhance lives and heighten awareness by monitoring any heart rate irregularities. BeatTune was able to show if the heart rate readings were in line with the type of activity. It was also able to highlights any irregularities that show up and keep a record of them.</p><h2>Impact:</h2><ul><li><strong>Top Apple Watch app of 2015</strong> by AppAdvice</li><li><strong>Top 3</strong> in Health and Fitness in the German Apple Store, 18th December - Featured in Product Hunt with over 100 votes</li><li>Press Coverage:</li></ul><ul><li><em>BeatTune: Meaningful Heart Rate alerts you of risk</em> by AppAdvice</li><li><em>BeatTune für Apple Watch: Ein sinnvolle Herzfrequenz-Anzeige</em> by iPhone-ticker.de</li></ul></article></li><li><article><h1>Nylstar Collections</h1><p align="center">

</p><h3>My contribution</h3><p>This was my first project as an iOS Developer. I was part of a team of 4 highly motivated guys craving for knowledge and excited about Swift.</p><p>We built the app from scratch and many of it’s following iterations once it was published in the AppStore. The work made demanded a lot of communication, collaboration, and iterations in design.</p></article></li></ul></div><footer><p>Generated using <a href="https://github.com/johnsundell/publish">Publish</a></p><p><a href="/feed.rss">RSS feed</a></p></footer></body></html>
